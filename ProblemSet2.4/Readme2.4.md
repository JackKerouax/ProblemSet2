For problem 2.4
I wasn't too sure whether I gave the right answer to this question? 
I know that BPM stands for beats per mintues, and every minute there are 60,000 milliseconds, so I simply used 600,00 divided by beats per mintues (BPM) in order to calculate the milliseconds interval representation.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.
